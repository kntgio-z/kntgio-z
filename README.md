# 🌟 Hey there, I’m Gio! 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a **backend developer** who loves bringing ideas to life with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and a sprinkle of creativity. Coding has been my way of exploring, problem-solving, and creating cool things that (hopefully) make a difference.

## 🚀 **What I Work With**  
I’ve dabbled in a lot of stuff, but here’s what I spend most of my time with:  

🎯 **Languages:**  
- 🛠 **C** – My first programming language. It taught me the basics and a lot of patience.  
- ☕ **Java** – For all those Object-Oriented hours in school (and yes, plenty of coffee).  
- 🌐 **JavaScript & TypeScript** – The dynamic duo that powers most of my projects.  
- 🖥️ **PHP** – A reliable old friend I still turn to.  

🌟 **Frameworks and Tools:**  
- ⚛️ **React** – My go-to for building fast and fun user interfaces.
- ⚛️ **React Native** – My framework buddy for making cross-platform mobile applications.  
- 🚀 **Node.js & Express** – Perfect for backend work and turning logic into actions.  
- 🏗️ **Yii2** – Making PHP even better, one framework at a time.

## 🌴 **A Bit About Me**  
I’m based in the **Philippines**, where it’s always a good day for coffee and coding.  

I dream of creating apps, tools, and systems that genuinely make life easier for people (big or small, it all counts). Outside of coding, I’m always up for learning new things, playing games, or tackling life like a series of fun challenges to solve.
