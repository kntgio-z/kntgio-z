# Hi! I'm Gio.

I am a backend developer who loves coding with JavaScript. So far, these are the skills I've gained in my programming journey:
- Proficiency in C language (my first steps into programming)
- Transitioning programming knowledge from C to Java, an object-oriented language
- Full-stack web development (basics, with React)
- Mobile development, particularly in React Native (basics)
- API development with REST, using Express
- JavaScript framework programming (currently building my own Express framework)
- Databases (RDBMS, specifically MySQL)

Here are the things I'm looking forward to:
- Learning Docker
- Exploring more about native development (Desktop, Mobile)
- Gaining deeper knowledge and techniques in backend development
- Becoming proficient in other programming languages (at least Python or Go)
- Learning about the nature of Deno and Bun

## Projects

### POScan
**Description**
This project is a native mobile application, made with React Native, used to connect with a specific POS system to act as a mobile barcode scanner. This project aims to streamline inventory management by allowing users to quickly scan product barcodes and send the data directly to the POS system for real-time updates, reducing manual entry errors and improving efficiency. It also minimizes additional costs by eliminating the need to purchase a separate barcode scanner.
**Stack**
- Express
- React Native (with Expo)
